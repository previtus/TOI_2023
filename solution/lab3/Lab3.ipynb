    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this practical, we will implement and compare two important types of routing protocols, the distance-vector (DV) protocol and the link-state (LS) protocol. In this lab, the Python kernel will researt everytime you run an experiment, so the program will intentionally shut down the kernel everytime. If you see the warning \"The kernel appears to have died. It will restart automatically.\", it's completely normal and you do not need to do anything about it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1 The NetSim simulator\n",
    "In this practical, we will primarily use the NetSim simulator, which is similar with the WSim simulator used in the previous practical. NetSim executes a set of steps every time slot, where time increases by 1 each slot. During each time slot a node can deliver one packet to its one-hop neighbour nodes via direct wireless links. You will have the full access to the source code p3_netsim.py, and you can try to read it and find out how the simulator works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code in Section 3 (Distance-vector routing). You may see something like this (Just ignore the blue dot):\n",

    "| numnodes | Number of nodes | 12 |\n",
    "| simtime | Simulation time | 2000 |\n",
    "| rand | Use randomly generated topology | False |\n",

    "You can click on the nodes to see the current neighbour and routing information in the terminal window. Note that now it should be pretty empty, and after you implement the routing protocols you should be able to see the neighbour list and routing table/costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you set *gui* to False, the simulator will run itself against several test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2 Test cases\n",
    "Your protocols will be tested against the following test cases (see p3_tests.py): \n",
    "\n",
    "**Euclidean network**: the cost on the edges of the network is Euclidean, i.e. for three nodes A, B and C, we have (cost(AB) + cost(BC) > cost(AC), and the links between nodes are stable. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-Euclidean network**: the links between nodes are stable, but the cost can be non-Euclidean.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Network with cost changes**: the cost of the edges may change during simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Network with cost change and broken links**: the links between nodes are not stable and can break during simulation, while the cost may also change\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disconnected Network**: the network can become disconnected during simulation. \n",

    "### 3 Distance-vector routing\n",
    "In the distance-vector routing protocol, each node periodically broadcasts to its neighbours about its current routing table, i.e. a vector \\[(dst1, cost1), (dst2, cost2), …\\], which describes the current cost of reaching each destination from itself. When receiving such an advertisement from a neighbour, the node updates its current routing table accordingly. In this practical, we assume the links in the network are bi-directional with symmetric cost, i.e. the cost of a link from A to B is the same as that of B to A. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement both the advertisement and integration steps. We provide the code skeleton below. Here is some key information you might need when implementing your functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "*self.routes*, which is the routing table of the node. It is a python dictionary \\[dst1, link1; dst2, link2, …\\], which maps a destination node to a *Link*. A *Link* object e.g. link1, represents the edge that connects the current node to its next hop neighbour towards the destination dst1. The cost associated with the link can be obtained by calling *link1.cost* (a variable defined in class *Link*). For instance, suppose node A connects to B, which then connects to C. Then in the routing table of A, you would see an entry \\[C, link<sub>AB</sub> \\]. link<sub>AB</sub> can be obtained by calling *self.getlink(B)* (assuming your code is running on node A). Your code should update this routing table when you receive information from other nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "*self.spcost*, which is the cost table of the node. It is a python dictionary \\[dst1, cost1; dst2, cost2, …\\], which maps a destination node to the currently estimated cost of getting there. Your code should set this cost table as well.\n"

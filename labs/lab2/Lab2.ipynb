    "##  Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical, we will implement some contention-free (TDMA) and contention-based (Aloha and CSMA) MAC protocols, and study their performance in different context. In this lab, the Python kernel will researt everytime you run an experiment, so the program will intentionally shut down the kernel everytime. If you see the warning \"The kernel appears to have died. It will restart automatically.\", it's completely normal and you do not need to do anything about it.\n",
    "### 1 Performance Metrics\n",
    "To evaluate the performance of a MAC protocol, we consider the following two metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Utilisation *U***, which is the ratio of the total throughput of all nodes to the maximum data rate of the channel. Intuitively, higher utilisation means the protocol uses the wireless channel better, without unnecessary idle. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Fairness *F***, which is defined as: \n",
    "<img src=\"fig1.png\" style=\"zoom:40%\" />\n",
    "Here N is the total amount of nodes, Ui  is the utilisation of each node. Clearly, if just one node occupies the channel, F would be 1/N, which is the worst case. If all nodes use the channel equally, F would be 1, which is the best case we want to achieve. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2 The WSim simulator \n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical, we will primarily use the WSim simulator. It is a simple packet level network simulator for a shared media network. In WSim, all the nodes run the same MAC protocol, and it executes a set of steps every time slot (time increments by 1 each slot). You will have the full access to the source code, and you can implement your own protocols as you wish. For this practical, we have provided the code template that runs, and your main task is to understand and compare different MAC protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3 TDMA \n",
    "In this set of tasks, you will learn how to use the WSim simulator by running simulations of TDMA. As discussed in the lecture, TDMA divides time into slots (assume the length of each slot is 1), and the nodes send data one by one. Say we have N nodes. Then at time t, the i-th node will transmit if and only if \n",
    "-\tIt has some data to send; and \n",
    "-\tt mod N == i\n",

    "Now you are familiar with the WSim simulator. In this practical, we will explore how to stable Aloha with a backoff strategy. As explained in the lecture, if a node fails to transmit a packet, it retransmits at a future slot with a certain probability p. This approach is not stable, since in practice for different amount of nodes with different loads, the optimal p value is unknown. To address this problem, we should consider a smarter strategy. \n",

The input parameter *time* is the current timestamp maintained by the node, *ptime* is the length of the packet to be sent, and *numnodes* is the total number of nodes. In this task, you don’t need to worry about the input parameters, and your code should return True if it is clear to send, and False otherwise. You can tell if the channel is busy or not by calling the function *self.network.channel_busy()*. Note that unlike the previous slotted Aloha, here we should allow packet size to be different from the slot size, e.g. the nodes can transmit packets of length 10 at the beginning of each timestamp. Also, don’t forget the node has to transmit according the probability *p*."
